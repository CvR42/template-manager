Subject: [ANN] Version 2.1.0 of Tm, a template preprocessor, avaiable
Keywords: template, Tm, abstract syntax tree 

Hello everyone, 

Version 2.1.0 of Tm is now available for downloading.

The main change is that it now available from a new website:
<http://www.few.vu.nl/~reeuwijk/software/Tm/downloading.html>


Also, there are some bugfixes and some new functionality, in particular
in the Tm template language.

- In libtmc, made cmp_tmsymbol() use strcmp(), since ordering based on
  pointer value is non-portable.
- Some changes to the Tm macro language:
  * Added a '.for' command
  * Changed the '-' and '/' operator in '$[]' expressions to be left binding.
    Thus, $[3-2-1] is now equivalent to $[(3-2)-1]. This is more in line with
    standard mathematical practice.
  * Division/modulus by zero in template expressions is now detected.
- Fixed a bug in constructor/classname parsing in a fscan_<type>()
  support function in libtmc.
- cmp_tmsymbol() now uses strcmp instead of comparing pointers.
- Even more bracketing in macros in headers.
