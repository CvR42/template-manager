== How to install Tm ==

For people familiar with GNU Autoconf: all the standard configure
flags and all the standard make targets are supported. There are
no special configuration flags, so it is probably not necessary to
read all these instructions. However, please read the warning at
the end of this file.

== Detailed installation instructions ==

Before you can compile Tm, you must configure the Makefiles and the
configuration header files.  You do this by simply typing

    ./configure

at the command prompt. This will set reasonable defaults for the
compilation.  See the section "Changing compilation options" below if
you want the change the installation directory or the command to invoke
the C compiler.

After you have run the configuration script, you can make all compilation
targets with

    make all

run some tests on the results with

    make check

install the software with

    make install

and remove the installed software with

    make uninstall

To delete the intermediate files generated by the complation process,
use

    make clean

or use

    make empty

to delete all files that can be generated from other files.

There are other targets in the Makefile. Do

    make help

to get an overview of them.


== Changing compilation options ==

The configure script will determine on what kind of system you are,
and will adapt a number of parameters accordingly. If the configure
script can find the GNU C compiler (gcc), it will use that, else it
will use the standard C compiler on your system (cc). To over-ride
this behavior, you can give configure an value for the compiler
variable `CC' by setting it in the environment.  For example (assuming
you use the csh(1)):

    setenv CC cc -Aa
    ./configure

If 'setenv' does not work, see the section "Setting environment variables"
below. The environment variable needs only be visible at the moment
you run configure.

The program will be installed in <prefix>/bin. By default <prefix> is
determined by the place the GNU compiler is found, or if that cannot
be found it is '/usr/local'.  To change the prefix, you can give
configure the option '--prefix=<path>'. For example, with

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/blob

Tm will be installed in /usr/blob/bin.


== Documentation ==

The documentation can be found in the directory 'manual'. Do

    make doc

in this directory to build the manual. This requires pdflatex.



== Setting environment variables ==

In these installation instructions, environment variables are set with
the command `setenv'. For example:

  setenv CC cc -Aa

This only works in the `csh' shell and variants (for example `tcsh').
For Bourne-like shells setting environment variables is done like this:

  export CC="cc -Aa"

== ***WARNING*** ==

To compile Tm you need files generated by Tm! In the distributed
version this is solved by including these files in the distribution
and the repository, but before you do 'make clean' make sure that
you have succesfully compiled and installed libtmc, tm and tmc, or
be prepared to restore these files from the distribution or repository.
