This directory contains the LaTeX sources of the Tm documentation.
The documentation covers Tm itself, the Tm C templates and support
library, and some example projects.

The distribution contains a ready-made `main.pdf' file.

If you want to compile the document yourself, you need to have the Tm
kernel packages with the same version number installed, and have Tm in
your search path. That is, you must be able to invoke Tm by simply typing
`tm'.

Under these conditions, a simple

   make all

should be sufficient to produce a fresh version of the main.pdf file.
