This directory contains four directories that form the kernel of
the Template Manager ('Tm').  If you want to know what has changed
in the most recent distribution, see the CHANGES file.

Tm is covered by the GNU General Public License. Briefly, this means
that you are free to use the program and its sources, but you are not
allowed to ask money for the program or the sources.

Tm templates and libraries are covered by the GNU Library Public
License. Briefly, this means that you can use code generated with Tm,
code generated from standard Tm templates, and Tm libraries linked to
your program, even in commercial programs.

See the files gpl.txt and lgpl.txt for the text of the two licenses.

Tm uses GNU autoconf for configuration management, so the standard sequence

    ./configure ; make all ; make check ; make install

applies. For more detailed instructions see the INSTALL file.

Tm C templates has been compiled and tested on the following systems:
 - Debian Linux with the GNU C compiler
 - MacOS X with Apple's developer tools.

Older versions have been compiled on lots of other UNIX systems, and
on SunOS, Atari, and Windows.
