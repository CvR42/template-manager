Welcome to the Tm Pascal template.

General
-------

This directory contains the directories that form the Pascal template of the
Template Manager ('Tm'). 

These templates are not as fully supported as the C templates. This is
partially because they are more seldomly used, and partially because
there is less standardization in the Pascal world.

*** Warning ***

These templates are provided without any guarantee that they will
work properly. It has been some time ago when they were last tested.
