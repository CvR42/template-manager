Hello everyone, 

Version 2.1.0 of Tm is now available for downloading.

The main change is that it now available from a new website:
<http://www.few.vu.nl/~reeuwijk/software/Tm/downloading.html>


Also, there are some bugfixes and some new functionality, in particular
in the Tm template language:

* There is a new .for command.
* The -, /, and % operators in $[] expressions are now left-binding.
* Division and modulus by zero in $[] expressions now cause an error.
