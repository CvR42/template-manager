\chapter{Upgrading code using the old {\C} templates}
\label{s.upgrade}
The most recent version of the {\Tm} templates provide
\verb'to_<type>()' macros to convert to a subclass. This is also
used to access constructors from a constructor base type.
In previous versions of the {\Tm} templates this was done with
another macro; for example:
\begin{showfile}
\begin{verbatim}
void clear_leaf( btree tree )
{
    if( tree->tag == TAGBLeaf ){
        tree->BLeaf.v = 0;
    }
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{showfile}
The following {\Tm} template will produce a \texttt{sed} file that
will replace all old-style access expressions with the new ones.
\begin{showfile}
\verbatimtabinput{cast.t}
\end{showfile}
The conversion is not perfect: it will probably require some manual
modifications, but nevertheless it will simplify the modification
considerably.
\par
Another useful tool is the following script:
\begin{showfile}
\verbatimtabinput{ch.sh}
\end{showfile}
Given an \texttt{sed} script and a list of files, it will apply the
script to all files. Only the files that are actually changed are
touched, so that the required recompilation is reduced to a minimum.
