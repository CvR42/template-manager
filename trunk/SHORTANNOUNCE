Subject: [ANN] Version 2.0.9 of Tm, a template preprocessor, avaiable
Keywords: template, Tm, abstract syntax tree 

Hello everyone, 

Version 2.0.9 of Tm is now available for downloading. New in this
release is a template to generate analyzers. Such analyzers apply
a reduction operation (e.g. summation or boolean 'and' ) on a tree.
The template is useful for small analysis operations such as determining
the estimated code size of a function, or deciding wether an expression
is constant.

* The -, /, and % operators in $[] expressions are now left-binding.
* Division and modulus by zero in $[] expressions now cause an error.

Also, the Tm function 'reach' has been extended to accept a list of
blocking nodes.

As usual, Tm can be obtained from the Tm downloading page:
